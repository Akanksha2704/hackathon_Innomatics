Restaurants and Food Data Analysis – Hackathon Project
This project was completed as part of a hackathon focused on exploring restaurant and food-related data to uncover insights and patterns using data analysis and geospatial visualization.
 Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed detailed EDA using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Task 2 – Cuisine-Specific Mapping (Folium)
Created interactive maps using Folium to visualize the geographical spread of various cuisines. This helped in understanding regional food preferences and hotspots.
Task 3 – Interactive Density Mapping (Folium)
Developed interactive heatmaps to display high-density restaurant zones based on user ratings, cuisine type, and cost. It allowed for a better understanding of urban food trends.
